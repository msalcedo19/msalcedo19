### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mateo but if you prefer you can call me Matthew ðŸ˜„

# About Me

I'm a software Engineering who is passionate in learn something new every day and applying it to real or my own projects. I have had the opportunity to work with a broad quantity of technologies like React, Angular, Vue, NodeJs, ASP.NET, Flask, Django, Flutter, MongoDB, Firebase, Postgress, AWS and a large, etc. But now, I'm focused on improving my backend skills because I feel it's time to know more deeply about all technologies and techniques that are related to the backend side. 

# Technologies 
1. Python - Flask/Django
2. Dart - Flutter
3. Git
4. AWS - EC2/S3/Load balancers
5. Heroku
6. Postman

# Fun fact
I chose my degree discarding everything else the previous night to the deadline. Hopefully, that was the better decision that I make until today because I love the possibilities of what I and you can do with the technology.
