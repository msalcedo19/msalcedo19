### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mateo but if you prefer you can call me Matthew ðŸ˜„

# About Me

I'm a software Engineering who is passionate in learn something new every day and applying it to real or my own projects. I have had the opportunity to work with a broad quantity of technologies like React, Angular, Vue, NodeJs, ASP.NET, Flask, Django, Flutter, MongoDB, Firebase, Postgress, AWS and a large, etc. But now, I'm focused on improving my backend skills because I feel it's time to know more deeply about all technologies and techniques that are related to the backend side. 

Currently, I have 3+ experience in the technology industry building APIs, debugging and fixing issues in complex systems, and designing, implementing, and deploying projects using AWS services mostly. Also, I have good writing and speaking skills in English and Spanish.

# Main Technologies
1. Python - Flask/Django/FastAPI
2. Kafka
3. Git
4. AWS - EC2/S3/Load balancers/SQS/SNS
5. Linux
6. Kubernetes

# Fun fact
I chose my degree discarding everything else the previous night to the deadline. Hopefully, that was the best decision that I make because I love the possibilities of what I and you can do with the technology. Also, that decision changed my life in many ways but mainly it makes me meet incredible people that motivate me to be the best version of myself.
